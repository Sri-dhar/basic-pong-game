# Basic Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python. The game is developed as part of the Day 22 project in my coding journey.

## Game Overview

The game consists of two paddles and a ball. The goal of each player is to prevent the ball from reaching their side of the screen by moving their paddle up and down.

## Game Controls

- Player 1:
  - Use the 'w' key to move the paddle up.
  - Use the 's' key to move the paddle down.

- Player 2:
  - Use the 'Up' arrow key to move the paddle up.
  - Use the 'Down' arrow key to move the paddle down.

## Game Rules

- If a player misses the ball, the other player gets a point.
- The game ends when a player reaches a predefined score.

## Installation and Running the Game

To run the game, you need Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git

2. Navigate to the 'basic-pong-game' directory:

Enjoy the game!
